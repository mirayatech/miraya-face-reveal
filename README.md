# My Face Reveal

Hey there! So... this is me! 😊 

I drew myself using only CSS because why not? It's basically a little animated version of me that blinks and does cute things when you hover over it.

## What's This?

Just pure html and css.. no fancy frameworks or images needed! I built my entire face using css shapes, shadows, and some creative border-radius magic. She even blinks every few seconds like a real person hehe.

## How to See It

Just open `index.html` in your browser and meet me! 

## The Fun Bits

- I blink naturally (watch for it!)
- Hover over me for a surprise
- All my colors are customizable with CSS variables
- Made with ponytail and everything ✨

Want different colors? Just change these in the CSS:

```css
:root {
  --skin-color: #ce9470;    /* my skin tone */
  --shirt-blue: #6485ef;    /* my shirt */
  --hair-dark: #1e110c;     /* my hair */
  /* and more... */
}
```

*Created with CSS and a lot of patience 💕*
